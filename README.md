## Content

- A record must contain actionable principles guiding moral, ethical, or practical decisions. Avoid descriptions of subject matter, history, definitions, or context that doesn't offer guidance or actionable principles.
- A record must contain one atomic idea.
- A record must only feature text available on the page.
- A record must be unique.
- A record must not repeat information.

## Style

- A record must express ideas accurately with the least amount of words, preferably 10 words or less. Extra words increase processing time, editing time, and the chance of errors.
- A record must aim to be word-for-word but can simplify jargon, remove filler words, shorten long quotes, and merge quotes to form one cohesive idea.
- A record must use numerals (e.g., 0) instead of words (e.g., zero).

## Prohibited Content

- A record must not promote illegal content.
- A record must not promote the Seven Deadly Sins (e.g., pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth).

## Data Validation

- A record must fill all database fields otherwise it's invalid.

## Text Modifications

  - Author: "Bob: text".

- Text: main quoted material.
- Access Date: relative date the source was viewed to track changes. Date format: day month year (e.g., 11 Feb 2025).
