# Wisdom-Database

- The wisdom database is designed to provide a structured collection of concise actionable principles from diverse sources to make better moral, ethical, and practical decisions.
- The project is continously evolving over time so some things may be subject to change.

# Databases

- Mental Tools: concepts that improve thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving.
- Practical Tools: techniques for taking action and getting things done.

- Offical Quotes: advice or reflections from philosophers and thinkers. Depending on how the project unfolds this will either be removed due to other services storing quotes or only have very specific helpful quotes.
- Personal Quotes: personal sayings submited by users.

## Content

- A record must contain actionable ideas, advice, and principles to guide decisions.
- A record must contain one atomic idea or compact frameworks.
- A record must be unique.
- A record must not repeat information.

## Style

- A record should summarize ideas to be conicse, accurate, and easy to understand. Use simple word for word statements if they're available. Simplify jargon, remove filler words, shorten long quotes, and merge quotes to form one cohesive idea.
- A record should express ideas using the least amount of words, preferably 10 words or less. Extra words increase processing time, editing time, the chance of errors, and make it harder to memorize.
- A record must use numerals (e.g., 0) instead of words (e.g., zero) better readability.

## Prohibited Content

- A record must not promote illegal content.
- A record must not promote the Seven Deadly Sins (e.g., pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth).

## Data Validation

- A record must fill in all database fields otherwise it's invalid.

## Text Modifications

- Prefixes (choose one if it applies):
- Ellipses (…): show shortened and merged ideas (e.g., evaluate alternatives by weighing their benefits, drawbacks, ... and likelihoods).

## Database Fields

- Category: single keyword category (e.g., philosophy). It's assigned based on the best guess.
- Text: summary or quote.
- Access Date: relative date the source was viewed to track changes. Date format: day month year (e.g., 11 Feb 2025).
- Source: URL, book, or other reference.

## Examples Of Content To Avoid

- First-person subject description:
  > Wisdom, also known as sapience, is the ability to apply knowledge, experience, and good judgment to navigate life’s complexities.[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom)
- Third-person subject description:
  > Philosophers have explored wisdom as a fundamental concept for millennia, debating its nature, acquisition, and role in ethical and intellectual life.[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom)
- Types of categories without an actionable point:
  > Theoretical wisdom (sophia), which involves deep contemplation of universal truths. Practical wisdom (phronesis), which is the ability to make sound decisions in everyday life.[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom)
- Fun facts:
  > Philosophy literally means the love of wisdom.[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom)
